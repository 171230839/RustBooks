###[The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) *Free*

Welcome! This book will teach you about the Rust Programming Language. Rust is a systems programming language focused on three goals: safety, speed, and concurrency. It maintains these goals without having a garbage collector, making it a useful language for a number of use cases other languages aren’t good at: embedding in other languages, programs with specific space and time requirements, and writing low-level code, like device drivers and operating systems. It improves on current languages targeting this space by having a number of compile-time safety checks that produce no runtime overhead, while eliminating all data races. Rust also aims to achieve ‘zero-cost abstractions’ even though some of these abstractions feel like those of a high-level language. Even then, Rust still allows precise control like a low-level language would.

While systems programming languages have greatly evolved since the introduction of C more than 40 years ago, our capacity for dumb mistakes with enormous consequences has remained unchanged, with vivid examples regularly in the news. This O'Reilly report examines Rust, a new systems programming language that combines safety and security with performance on a par with C and C++.

Starting by comparing Rust with other programming languages, this book will show you where and how to use Rust. It will discuss primitive types along with variables and their scope, binding and casting, simple functions, and ways to control execution flow in a program.

Next, the book covers flexible arrays, vectors, tuples, enums, and structs. You will then generalize the code with higher-order functions and generics applying it to closures, iterators, consumers, and so on. Memory safety is ensured by the compiler by using references, pointers, boxes, reference counting, and atomic reference counting. You will learn how to build macros and crates and discover concurrency for multicore execution.

By the end of this book, you will have successfully migrated to using Rust and will be able to use it as your main programming language.

This practical book introduces systems programmers to Rust, the new and cutting-edge language. You’ll learn how Rust offers the rare and valuable combination of statically verified memory safety and low-level control—imagine C++, but without dangling pointers, null pointer dereferences, leaks, or buffer overruns.
