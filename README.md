Elixir-School is an open and community driven effort inspired by Twitter’s Scala School. The site’s content consists of peer-reviewed lessons on various Elixir topics that range in difficulty. The lessons are currently available in over 10 languages to help make programming Elixir more accessible to non-English speakers.

While systems programming languages have greatly evolved since the introduction of C more than 40 years ago, our capacity for dumb mistakes with enormous consequences has remained unchanged, with vivid examples regularly in the news. This O'Reilly report examines Rust, a new systems programming language that combines safety and security with performance on a par with C and C++.

Starting by comparing Rust with other programming languages, this book will show you where and how to use Rust. It will discuss primitive types along with variables and their scope, binding and casting, simple functions, and ways to control execution flow in a program.

Next, the book covers flexible arrays, vectors, tuples, enums, and structs. You will then generalize the code with higher-order functions and generics applying it to closures, iterators, consumers, and so on. Memory safety is ensured by the compiler by using references, pointers, boxes, reference counting, and atomic reference counting. You will learn how to build macros and crates and discover concurrency for multicore execution.

By the end of this book, you will have successfully migrated to using Rust and will be able to use it as your main programming language.
